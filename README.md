OpenLyrics Library for Java
===========================

Overview
--------

Generic library with OpenLyrics parser and writer for Java.
Library is used for parsing OpenLyrics XML into a complex Java POJO
and contains utilities to export the result back.


Limitations
-----------

Export and import still limited.
But if you find something missing, feel free to contribute patches. :-)


Further Direction
-----------------

This library is based on OpenLyrics v 0.8 specifications.
However the plans of 0.9 are not yet clear and OpenLyrics
is tightened to a particular project: OpenLP and thus its
functionality at first place.

Thefore future development may use own dialect, based on OpenLyrics,
although keeping backward compatibility with the current version.
